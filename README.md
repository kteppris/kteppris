ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Keno Teppris, an Industrial Engineering graduate with a focus on Informatics. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Applied Data Science and working as a Scientific Employee at the Applied Science University of LÃ¼beck. My research revolves around the practical applications of Artificial Intelligence.

ðŸ’» I'm passionate about Python, PyTorch, and Machine Learning in general. I also enjoy working with APIs, setting up servers (Proxmox, etc.), and diving into the world of Deep Learning, including LLMs, Computer Vision, and GNNs.

ðŸš€ Recently, I've been working on a novel Deep Learning method with Graph Neural Networks for quality assurance in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). Additionally, I'm developing an LLM-based Question Answering Chatbot for institute content, which is currently a work in progress.

ðŸ“š Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories for more exciting projects and collaborations. Let's push the boundaries of AI together!
